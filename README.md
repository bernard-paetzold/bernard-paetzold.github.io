# Virtual CV

Welcome! This is the codebase for my virtual CV, it may be quite different from what the average portfolio or showcase website looks like. Given that I see no point in making such a website if it is not unique.  

## Overview of features

The main element is the virtual computer, this contains the actual CV, including pages for skills, projects, contact information, etc.

Other elements are also interactable, the radio for example has working controls and can play one of seven tracks. The rest do not server any function besides entertainment. 

## Why pixel art?

The website makes extensive use of art assets and background images, the issue with these is often scaling, but the benefit of going with pixel art is that browers support a "crisp rendering" mode or images that allows them to scale perfectly without becoming blurry. This allows the website to work on various devices while having assets that might otherwise be limiting.

## Scaling

As is often the case with websites, scaling was a challenge. However with some extra Javascript functions it scales reasonably well to mobile phones. The biggest challenge was getting text to remain in the proper places and still be readable.
